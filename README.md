## Description 
-------------------
The ecommerce project has a back end for an e-commerce site. I used Express.js API to use Sequelize in order to interact with a MySQL database. It executes the following: 

1. When the user opens API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags, then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
2. WHEN the user test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core, then I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
